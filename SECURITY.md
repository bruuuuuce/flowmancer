# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe.

## Supported Versions

We aim to provide security updates for the latest released minor version. Older versions may receive fixes on a best‑effort basis.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues responsibly. Do not create public GitHub issues for sensitive reports.

Preferred reporting methods:

1. Private Vulnerability Reporting (recommended):
   - If enabled for this repository, use the "Report a vulnerability" button on GitHub (Security tab → Private vulnerability reporting). This sends a private report to the maintainers.
2. Email (fallback):
   - If the button above is not available, email: REPLACE_WITH_SECURITY_EMAIL
   - Please include steps to reproduce, affected versions/commit, and any PoC you can share.

We will make a best effort to acknowledge your report within 2 business days and provide an initial assessment within 7 business days. We will keep you informed about the fix progress and coordinate a disclosure timeline with you.

## Scope

- Application source code in this repository, including build scripts and configuration.
- Please do not test against live users without explicit permission. Avoid data exfiltration; use minimal proof‑of‑concepts.

## Responsible Disclosure

- We prefer coordinated disclosure: we will work with you on a fix and publish advisories (GHSA) when updates are available.
- If a vulnerability is found to impact downstream users, we will issue a GitHub Security Advisory and, when possible, provide mitigation guidance.

## GPG / Verification

If you would like to encrypt your message, you can optionally send a GPG‑encrypted report using your own key exchange process. Maintainers will provide a public key upon request.

## Thank you

We appreciate your efforts to improve the security of this project.
